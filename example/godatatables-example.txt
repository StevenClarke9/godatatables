example processing of csv files with godatatables.

We have two csv files. One is a list of pet owners and the other is a list of pets.

owners.txt
ID|Name|Location
1|Steven|Brisbane
2|Krissy|Brisbane
3|Cathy|Sydney
4|Peter|Melbourne

pets.txt
ID|OwnerID|Name|Type
1|1|Chai|Dog
2|2|Misha|Cat
3|3|April|Cat
4|4|Rodger|Dog

these two files are created in the https://github.com/StevenClarke9/gotatatables/example directory.

create a "petowners.go" file. This is the main package souce code file.
